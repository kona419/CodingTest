Given a table in the form of headers and data lines separated by \n and values are separated by , return the max value given a column name.
Example:
given S = "id,name,age,act.,room,dep.\n1,Jack,68,T,13,8\n17,Betty,28,F,15,7"
C = "age"
it should return 68

To help ilustrate the example above here is a formatted version of the data

id	name	age	room	dep
1	Jack	68	T	8
17	Betty	28	F	7
as you can see, the maximum value in the column age is 68
